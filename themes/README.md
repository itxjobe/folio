# Folio themes

A theme is one small JSON file with a look: icons, badges, glass, text on Home and the status bar. It never
touches your apps, pages, widgets or permissions.

## Use a theme

- **In Folio:** Settings › Themes › **Import Theme…** and pick the file.
- **From another app:** share the `.json` file to **Folio Theme** (Files, Chrome downloads, a chat). Folio asks before
  applying it.
- Changed your mind? Settings › Themes › **Undo Theme Change**.

To make your own, set things up how you like and use Settings › Themes › **Save Current Look as Theme…**.

> Folio themes pair well with icon packs. Those are made by independent designers, so if you use one, please buy it
> from them on Google Play. Much love.

## Share a theme here

1. Save your look from Folio and give it a name (up to 40 characters).
2. Set `"iconPack"` to `null`. Other people won't have your icon pack installed.
3. Add the file to this folder as `your-theme-name.json` and open a pull request.
4. `CommunityThemesTest` checks every file in this folder. Run `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` before opening the PR.

## Format

`"folioTheme": 1` marks the file as a Folio theme (version 1). Anything missing or unknown falls back to Folio's
default for that field.
